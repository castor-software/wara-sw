# WASP Research Arena for Software

The WARA for Software is a planned [WASP](http://wasp-sweden.org/) research arena.  Its goals are to
- Foster collaboration between software technology and software engineering researchers and WASP industrial partners
- Provide a research focus for WASP software technology and software engineering researchers
- Provide resources for software technology and software engineering researchers, especially students
- Support Open Source software through
  - Analysing and improving selected Open Source software projects
  - Contributing Open Source software development tools
  - Understanding strengths and limitations of existing tools and processes in the Open Source development process
